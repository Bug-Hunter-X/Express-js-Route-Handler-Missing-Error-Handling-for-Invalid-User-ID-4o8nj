# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input.  The provided `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters without handling cases where the ID is not a valid integer.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` route handler attempts to find a user based on an ID provided in the request parameters. However, it fails to handle the scenario where the ID is not a valid integer, leading to potential errors such as `NaN` comparisons or crashes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses this issue by adding error handling.  It checks if the `userId` is a valid integer before attempting to find the user. If the ID is invalid or the user is not found, it returns an appropriate HTTP error response.
